Clock frequency = 10 MHz â†’ each clock = 100 ns

ðŸ§© Modified Timing Constraints: 
ðŸŸ© For Rows:
Each row remains active for 648 clocks.

After each row, leave 4 clock cycles of gap (buffer).

âœ… Total time per row = 648 + 4 = 652 clocks

ðŸŸ¦ For Columns:
Leave 4 clocks idle before col[0] activates.

Scan through all columns (as before).

Leave 4 clocks idle after col[639].

âœ… Total time for column enable = 4 (before) + 640 (scan) + 4 (after) = 648 clocks

So the row enable stays HIGH for the entire 648 clocks, during which:

4 idle clocks before column scan

640 active column shifts

4 idle clocks after column scan
